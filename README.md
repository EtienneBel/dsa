## Data Structures& Algorithms
The command sequence used to compile and run a Java program is :
```bash
  javac <Class>.java
```
- This command compiles the Java source file named Class.java.
The javac command stands for Java Compiler.
- If the compilation is successful, it will produce a bytecode file named <Class>.class

```bash
  java <Class>.java
```
- This command runs the compiled Java bytecode file.
- The java command invokes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to execute the bytecode contained in the <Class>.class file.
